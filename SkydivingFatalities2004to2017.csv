8,,49,8,Landing,,South Africa,2004-01-21,"From an eye-witness report: Graham Hoal was killed when he impacted a slowly-moving truck on the bridge over Theewaterskloof Dam.  The surface wind was light and constant. Graham, a well-known and very experienced skydiver, had been involved in the planning of the manoeuvre. He jumped from a helicopter and had set up an approach toward the truck, as part of a sequence for a commercial.  The scene called for a descending approach over the water for a short way toward the driver's cab, following which the parachutist would turn away in plenty of time to land behind the truck on the bridge. Graham, other skydivers and the safety co-ordinators all considered the manoeuvre fairly straightforward.  To lessen the pressure on the skydiver and allow more space for a safe landing, only the 'horse' (driver's cab section) was used, the load-box of the truck having been removed. There was a safety-boat standing by (with engine idling) below the bridge, in case the parachutist was forced to abort the manoeuvre and land in the water. Several 'takes' for the scene were expected. He was wearing a good buoyancy jacket as part of the costume for the scene.  Graham impacted the truck as he lost height during a steep hook-turn; and from our perspective, might not have survived, even had he missed the truck.",,Special,5000+,,Graham Hoal,,,Male,,

56,Yes,32,56,Collision,Javelin,Australia,2004-09-17,"<b>Background</b><br/> It was a clear cool day with 0-5 knot southerly winds. The jumper was a current ?E? Licensed holder with 102 jumps in the past six months and 30 jumps in the last month, most being camera jumps for 4-way or 8-way teams. The jump was his 4th jump of the day and part of a 4-way team-training day in preparation for the up-coming State Meet. The deceased was an experienced freeflier, flatflier, cameraperson and canopy pilot. <br/><br/> <b>The jump </b><br/> The deceased was the videographer for a four-way team, which was the first group to exit the Cessna Caravan at 13,500 feet. Exit time was approximately 4.30pm. The freefall and deployment were normal. The deceased was the first to open, deploying on break-off as briefed and was therefore higher under canopy than the other team members. During the course of his canopy descent he made some apparently intentional turns, which brought him down to the same level as the highest canopy of the four-way team. (It was common practice for the deceased to intentionally spiral down so as to loose height to land before the highest, more lightly loaded team member.) <br/><br/> This other jumper involved in the incident saw the canopy flying towards him, despite having the sun in his eyes, took evasive action to avoid collision. Even so, a glancing contact occurred at an altitude of not more than 300 feet. This jumper reported feeling lines and possibly some minor body contact indicating that the deceased was the lower of the two at the moment of contact. The deceased may have been only just straightening up from his turn, as the canopy appeared to still have some downwards momentum as the two collided. <br/><br/> The collision caused the deceased?s canopy to spin into a line twist and it continued to rotate rapidly until impact occurred a few seconds later. The altitude was so low that a cutaway was not an option and even an immediate reserve deployment without first cutting away may have had little effect. Although witnesses report that he was observed trying to control the canopy, he impacted at very high speed in an almost horizontal position. The other jumper involved in the collision landed safely nearby without further incident. (This DZ has a nominated landing pattern and a left hand turn to set up for landing is the rule and had been in place throughout the day.) <br/><br/> Those first to the scene found the deceased unconscious, not breathing and without a pulse. First-aid and CPR was administered at the site. This continued when the ambulance arrived and until the Medivac Helicopter arrived. A doctor pronounced the jumper dead at the site. <br/><br/> An inspection of the equipment showed no damage to the canopy or lines. His reserve handle and cutaway handle were in place. His brakes were released and the slider had been stowed indicating he had a normal opening and was in control of his canopy prior to the incident. The video camera was found to be running but examination of the footage showed that it had been turned off shortly after opening and restarted either by the impact or inadvertently by the one of the first persons on the scene. <br/><br/> <b>Conclusions</b><br/> The low angle of the sun (4.30pm) may have been a factor affecting the capacity of both jumpers to keep track of each other. Additionally the helmet-mounted camera worn by the deceased may have restricted his ability to look around for other canopies. (It was an open-faced style but with a fairly large camera mounted on the left.) It would seem that the deceased did not see the other canopy as he came out of the turns and therefore did not appear to take any action to avoid the collision. The avoiding action taken by the other jumper involved in the incident obviously reduced the potential for this to be a double fatality. At the height that the collision occurred there was little time available to the jumper to regain control of the canopy. <br/><br/> It is now common for clubs to be operating with larger aircraft and more jumpers attempting to land in the same landing areas with high performance canopies. It is critical that everyone takes extra care to know where people are in the air to reduce the incidence of canopy collisions and subsequent injury or death. <br/><br/> This incident highlights the need for vigilance and care by all whilst under canopy at all times. This is especially important at times when conditions and daylight may hinder a jumper?s vision and perception. <br/><br/>",Skydive Express,Camera or Video,715,Stiletto 135,Damien Frane Ivicevich,No,,Male,,3.5

58,,50,58,Malfunction,,United Kingdom,2004-09-24,"This incident involved a 1st jump AFF student.  According to reprots her canopy was flying fine from deployment to approx 1500 feet - she did all her control checks and was following intructions for landing i.e. she could turn and control it fine up until that point.  At 1500 feet her canopy went into a turn which continued until impact. She was on a radio and was observed by those on the ground to have both arms up. <br/><br/> Results of the BPA investigation:<br/> The Conclusions of the Board are that the free fall part of Jeanne?s descent went without incident and that her main parachute deployed correctly. However, the Board believes that as Jeanne attempted to take control of her parachute by taking hold of the steering toggles, she either: i) put her right hand through the loop of excess steering line stowed near the toggle, ii) put her hand through the loop of excess steering line and the toggle, or iii) put her hand through the steering toggle, and as she did this, the excess loop released and wrapped around the steering line itself. The Board believes that i) or ii) above, are the most likely scenarios. <br/> <br/> Any of the above would effectively cause the parachute to turn right if both of Jeanne?s hands were level above hear head. <br/> <br/> The Board believes that Jeanne steered back towards the PLA by pulling further down on her left toggle to compensate for the parachute?s right turn. Once she was over the edge of the PLA, she may have then let up on her left toggle, thus inducing a right turn. At this stage the CCI observed the continuing right turn and instructed her, by radio, to ?stop turning and let the right toggle up?. <br/> <br/> The Board believes that Jeanne carried out the instructions relayed to her and that her parachute then continued to spiral to the right until impact.",Hinton Skydiving Centre,AFF,1,,Jeanne Hallam,,,Female,,0

114,Cypres,74,114,Other,,United Kingdom,2005-05-21,"At approximately 10:50 hrs on Saturday 21st May 2005, Peter Shaw boarded a PAC 750XL aircraft along with fifteen other parachutists, which was to be the first parachuting lift of the day. <br/><br/> The aircraft climbed to approximately 13,000 ft AGL and ?ran in? above the PLA. When the aircraft was at the approximate ?exit point? the parachutists started to exit the aircraft. Peter was first to exit, followed approximately six seconds later by another ?solo? parachutist. They were then followed at short intervals by five groups of three parachutists, being five Tandem Instructors, their Student Parachutists and video-men. <br/><br/> Peter was not observed in freefall, but all other parachutists were seen to deploy their parachutes at normal heights. <br/><br/> Once it was realised a parachutist was missing, a search was instigated. The aircraft also took off with an instructor on board in an effort to locate Peter. He was located, from the air, approximately 0.9 miles to the north of the landing area. Both Peter?s parachutes were seen to be out and lying near him. <br/><br/> A Board of Inquiry was immediately formed and consisted of the NCSO and the Technical Officer. <br/><br/> The Conclusions of the Board are that the initial part of Peter?s free fall descent was probably uneventful. However, he failed to deploy his main parachute at the correct height (between 2,000 ? 3,000ft AGL). The Board believes that for some unknown reason Peter lost altitude awareness, even though he had an audible altimeter, which had been set at approximately 2,500ft, and deployed his main parachute at a low altitude, probably below 1,000ft AGL, and as, or shortly after his main parachute deployed his AAD activated, resulting in the reserve parachute deploying. <br/><br/> Peter may have tried to control the main parachute, as the steering toggles had been removed from their keepers. The Board believes that neither parachute became entangled with the other. However, it is likely that the descent rate had not slowed sufficiently, possibly because one, or both parachutes not being fully developed, which may have resulted in a heavy landing. <br/><br/> The Board noted that on a previous occasion, on jump number 929 on the 5th August 2001, a similar incident occurred, where Peter deployed his main parachute at a low altitude and his AAD fired at approximately the same time.

Reviewing his video: it clearly shows his left main riser releasing at roughly 350 ft. James was doing his normal 540 approach on a 90 comp Velo. There was a delay after the left riser release during which the partially detached main spun around; approx. 3 revolutions. This was followed by extremely low main cutaway. ames installed this canopy on different risers immediately before this load. At the time he was distracted, talking to two AFF students and several others in the packing area. As far as we know, he didn't have anyone check his main installation, and he didn't get a gear check before this jump. theory is that he possibly mis-routed his 3 rings in this way: He didn't put the white Type 2A riser loops through the grommets at the top of the cutaway cable housings before putting the cables through the loops. This might have allowed the housing to travel far enough away from the riser to let the cable release from the loop.",Triangle Skydiving Center,AFF,1800+,,James Stremmel,Yes,,Male,North Carolina,

At some point - not exactly clear on the video - he grabbed his right toggle through the front and rear risers. This resulted in the steering line now routing around the rear riser. It still seemed to work OK, but this would have added some friction to the system. His helmet was an open faced one with a forehead mounted GoPro. It had a cutaway system, but the events that follow happened too fast for that to matter. He did a 90 right front riser turn to final. Instead of pulling the right front riser straight down, he pulled it inward as well, in front of his face. At the same time, he looked right. At this point the right steering line caught on his camera. It was probably between the angle adjustment screw and the bottom of the camera. He realized what had happened and dropped the toggle to try to clear the steering line. I believe that the combined friction of the GoPro and the routing around the riser was enough to lock the steering line in place, which was somewhere around 18 to 24 inches of right control input. He quickly spun into the ground. The lighting was such that his shadow is quite sharp on the ground, and you can see the toggle fluttering above his helmet and the line routed down from the riser to his helmet.",Skydive Arizona,,1000,Crossfire 2,,,,Male,Arizona,
